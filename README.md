# Solid Interface

Solid Interface is a components library to build your accessible [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) components.

> ⚠️ This library is still in development and is not ready for production.

## Concepts

- 🚹 **Accessible**: The components are accessible by default.
- 📄 **CoC**: The library follows the [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
- 📚 **Documented**: The components are documented with examples and playgrounds.
- 🤸‍♀️ **Flexible**: The components are styleless by default, so you can style them as you want!
- 📦 **Small**: The library is small and tree-shakeable.
